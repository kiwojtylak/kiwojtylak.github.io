# kiwojtylak.github.io
kiwojtylak.github.io is the public website of Katarzyna (Kasia) I. Wojtylak

## How is this site built
This site is hosted on Gitlab Pages, and built using one of the Jekyll community templates. Jekyll allows to generate a static website, from markdown pages and SCSS.  
The main branch of the repository remains blank, and the repository is organized around different branches, each for a different Jekyll theme.
The site is published from the corresponding theme branch.

## Theme structure
The structure for the currently configured theme is as follows.
Original files have been renamed to start with underscore (ie: README.md to _README.md) instead of deleting or editing on top.

README.me: this file

BACKLOG.md: backlog of the latest tasks and bugfixes  

_config.yml: basic site attributes, like the currently configured theme, the hosting URL, tittle (displayed in several places), contact e-mail, description, author, selected locale, Google Analytics tracking code, or whether the portfolio section is displayed  

legal.md: markdown page for the "Privacy" section  

404.md: markdown page to display if a page is not found
