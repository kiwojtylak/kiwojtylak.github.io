| Since 2010, Kasia Wojtylak has been deeply engaged in conducting fieldwork, fostering a wealth of experience within the Witotoan communities (of Leticia and the Caraparana and Igaraparana Rivers in Colombia), a lifelong commitment which has resulted in her PhD thesis on the Murui-Muina language (James Cook University, Australia, 2017; published with Brill, 2020). Since 2018, she has been working with the Amazonian indigenous languages of the Caqueta-Putumayo (C-P) River Basins, Colombia - work which encompasses eight endangered languages spoken in the area, including the language involved in this project - Andoke. Her linguistic and sociolinguistic fieldwork experience involves working with:                                                                                                                               |

| *Andoke speakers*, Bogotá, Colombia (two sessions, Jun 2023). This was part of a pilot fieldwork to engage with the Andoke speakers in Colombia and lay foundations for future fieldwork on the language, as well as to prepare Jacob Menschel for fieldwork. It consisted of conducting extensive research on the Andoke language and culture prior to the fieldwork, considering the ethical implications of working with a highly endangered language in the Colombian context. Data collection, based on structured interviews, consisted of audio recordings of instructional texts and verbal art, as well as eliciting basic grammatical structures, investigating number marking and verbal morphological structure. Initial transcriptions and glossing were done in ELAN. The data is in the process of being archived at the DOBES-MPI archive. |

| *Lemko communities* of the Carpathian Mountains, Poland (3 months, Jun-Aug 2022). This was part of a bigger sociolinguistic study on Lemko, a minority language spoken in Poland. It explored how language is tied to identity, both individual and group-based. Dr Wojtylak was responsible for creating surveys and questionnaires, data collection and quantitative analysis of the data that was gathered during fieldwork. The ethnographic component of the work among the Lemko people included participant observation and in-depth interviews. The collected data, shared with the Lemko community, is stored with the University of Warsaw.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| *Murui community* of Kilometro 11, Leticia, Colombia (2 weeks, May 2017). The main goal of the fieldwork was to re-encounter with the Murui people and to redistribute the data gathered during fieldwork's conducted in 2013 and 2015-2016 (see below). It involved sociolinguistic work, based on in-depth interviews and surveys.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| *Murui community* of Tercera India, Colombia (6 months, Nov 2015-Apr 2016). The extensive immersion fieldwork - done as part of Dr Wojtylak’s PhD project on the reference grammar of the Murui language (2013-2017) - focused on: 1) collecting audiovisual data encompassing numerous genres, 2) gathering a series of texts with interlinear glosses and full translation, with notes on the social context of the texts, 3) a reasonably full lexicon in form of a thesaurus, by semantic fields, and 4) conducting in-depth analyses of the Murui language. The recordings were later partly annotated in ELAN and FLEx, and archived with James Cook University.                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| *Murui and Mɨnɨka community* of La Chorrera, Colombia (6 months, Jun-Jan 2013). This work aimed to establish foundational groundwork for documentation and description of Murui, ensuring community engagement and interest in the documentation of the Murui language. The fieldwork, part of Dr Wojtylak’s PhD thesis, was based on participants observation and data collection of natural speech (e.g. everyday conversations) and various genres (instructional, myths and songs) among the Murui and Mɨnɨka speakers. Dr Wojtylak conducted grammatical elicitations and in-depth analyses of the language. The recordings were later annotated in ELAN and FLEx, and archived with James Cook University. They will be made available within the DOBES-MPI archive.                                                                                 |

| *Murui community* in Leticia, Colombia (3 months, Jun-Sep 2010). The main goal of the fieldwork was to write a morphological description of the Murui (Witotoan) language as spoken in the community of Kilometro 11 in the municipality of Leticia. The fieldwork focused on engaging with the Murui community, networking, achieving basic proficiency in the language, collecting audio recordings (instructional texts and myths), and conducting grammatical elicitations. The recordings were annotated in FLEx. The data collected during fieldwork was used to write her MA thesis (“Witoto Murui phonology and verbal morphology”, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, 2012).                                                                                                                                                                           |
